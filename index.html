                    more than 40 years of business experience gathered from

                    partner, Npairoj Piempongsant, have distinguished themselves
                    in the fields of privatized infrastructure, industrial &

                    Current Focus - Privatized Infrastructure & Energy <br />
                     Today, EAH’s primary strength comes from its strategic
                    focus and expertise in the integrated infrastructure and
                    regional economic development sectors (smart cities,
                    airports, warehouse & logistics parks, fintech, conventional
                    & alternative energy and cross-border economic zones) ;
                    coupled with its exceptional global network of
                    high-net-worth investors, private companies, financial
                    institutions and government agencies that it collaborates
                    with throughout ASEAN and in strategic locations globally.
                    This focus has given rise to the firm’s outstanding
                    initiatives and active participation in several high-profile
                    projects in the infrastructure sector especially in
                    Thailand’s Eastern Seaboard (ESB) with the Thai Government’s
                    inauguration in March 2018 of the Eastern Economic Corridor
                    of Innovation (“EECi”) with its current PPP Tenders for the
                    privatization of the U-Tapao International Airport Project,
                    the High-Speed Train connecting Bangkok’s airports to
                    U-Tapao, the development of a new Airport City
                    “Aerotropolis” and the redevelopment of Ban Chang as a Smart
                    City.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Active projects also include the development of raw and
                    potable water supply for Ban Chang and Map Ta Phut
                    Industrial Estate and various mixed-use real estate projects
                    also located in Ban Chang. By employing a “total business
                    approach and win-win execution principle” to its carefully
                    selected projects and investments, coupled with its ability
                    to attract exceptional local partners for all of its
                    projects, EAH seeks always to achieve the vitally important
                    first-in advantage in emerging markets, speedy & highest
                    returns on investment and rapid overall value appreciation
                    for its clients and investment partners
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to Privatized Infrastructure, EAH is also
                    actively engaged in the Global Energy Sector today,
                    primarily in the development of world-wide markets and in
                    the investment in the required facilities, especially for
                    LNG trading, as well as crude oil and other petroleum
                    products. This new division of EAH was established in 2019
                    to serve as an effective and focused platform to not only
                    pursue and execute selected projects in the oil, gas and
                    energy sectors, but also to harness the vast experience and
                    talent of some of the industry’s most influential players,
                    including the Group’s Advisory Committee Chairman, Dr.
                    Tongchat Hongladaromp, who for years was the driving force
                    behind Thailand’s PTT as this leading Thai energy giant
                    evolved and grew rapidly to become one of Asia’s and the
                    world’s leading diversified energy companies. Aside from its
                    diverse experience and reputation, the main strength of
                    EAH’s Energy Division today is also derived from the group’s
                    continually expanding network of client companies, strategic
                    partners and global business leaders, especially focusing on
                    the GCC, Israel, Russia and China, where inter-regional
                    trade and investment opportunities are most promising.
